We implement three algorithms for finding MAT(maximum area triangle) in a convex polygon.

-  MAT-CM.h: implementation of an algorithm by Chadran and Mount (published in IJCGA 92).

-  MAT-K.h: implementation of an algorithm by Kallus (arXiv 1706.03049).

-  MAT-A.h: implementation of our algorithm based on Rotate-and-Kill.  ("A" stands for anonymity)

------

1.in to 7.in: 
    7 data cases generated by makedata.cpp

------

experiment.cpp is the main cpp file which tests the three algorithms using the data cases 1.in~7.in.

  It will generate 6 files for each test case ?.in:

    ?A.out ?C.out ?K.out: The answer to ?.in given by three algorithms respectively.

    ?A.txt ?C.txt ?K.txt: The number of iterations used by the three algorithms respectively.
